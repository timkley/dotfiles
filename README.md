# My personal dotfiles

My personal dotfiles, greatly inspired by [Freeks dotfiles](https://github.com/freekmurze/dotfiles) but tailored to my needs.

Backup of app settings is done with [Mackup](https://github.com/lra/mackup).

## Usage

```shell
git clone git@github.com:timkley/dotfiles.git .dotfiles
cd .dotfiles
chmod +x bootstrap
./bootstrap
```
